### Hi👋,

### I’m Jahedul Hasan (Leeon), or simply JH Leeon.

I’m currently working with Laravel, a PHP-based framework, serving as a backend web application developer where I build and maintain APIs for various services. I also have experience using Vue 3 for frontend stuff 😎.

I’ve got the basic skills in markup — I can build what’s needed, just not the kind of frontend magic that dedicated frontend devs do 😅. I often explore popular tech just to understand how they work and where they actually fit 🤘. I don’t really spend time chasing trends — if most real businesses don’t adopt them, they’re probably not worth it 🤷‍♂️.

📫 I’m always open to connect — not just for work. We can share ideas, discuss different perspectives, or even chat about life and philosophy.
